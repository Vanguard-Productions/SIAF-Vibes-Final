              Now and then, I think of when we were together<br />
              Like when you said you felt so happy you could die<br />
              Told myself that you were right for me<br />
              But felt so lonely in your company<br />
              But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember<br />
              <br />
              You can get addicted to a certain kinda sadness<br />
              Like resignation to the end, always the end<br />
              So when we found that we could not make sense<br />
              Well, you said that we would still be friends<br />
              But I'll admit that I was glad it was over<br />
              <br />
              But you didn't have to cut me off<br />
              Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin'<br />
              And I don't even need your love<br />
              But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough<br />
              <br />
              No, you didn't have to stoop so low<br />
              Have your friends collect your records and then change your
              number<br />
              Guess that I don't need that, though<br />
              Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br />
              Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br />
              Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br />
              <br />
              Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over<br />
              But had me believin' it was always somethin' that I'd done<br />
              But I don't wanna live that way<br />
              Readin' into every word you say<br />
              You said that you could let it go<br />
              And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to
              know<br />
              <br />
              But you didn't have to cut me off<br />
              Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin' (ah)<br />
              And I don't even need your love<br />
              But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (ah)<br />
              <br />
              No, you didn't have to stoop so low<br />
              Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
              (ah)<br />
              Guess that I don't need that, though<br />
              Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br />
              <br />
              Somebody I used to know<br />
              Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)<br />

              Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)<br />
