              I want you to stay<br />
              'Til I'm in the grave<br />
              'Til I rot away, dead and buried<br />
              'Til I'm in the casket you carry<br />
              <br />
              If you go, I'm going too, uh<br />
              'Cause it was always you, alright<br />
              And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me<br />
              Nothing left to lose without my baby<br />
              <br />
              Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know<br />
              I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone<br />
              Can't change the weather, might not be forever<br />
              But if it's forever, it's even better<br />
              <br />
              And I don't know what I'm cryin' for<br />
              I don't think I could love you more<br />
              It might not be long, but baby, I<br />
              I'll love you 'til the day that I die<br />
              'Til the day that I die<br />

              How you look to me, hm<br />
              You wouldn't believe if I told ya<br />
              You would keep the compliments I throw ya<br />
              <br />
              But you're so full of shit, uh<br />
              Tell me it's a bit, no<br />
              Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted<br />
              Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid<br />
              <br />
              And I don't know what I'm cryin' for<br />
              I don't think I could love you more<br />
              Might not be long, but baby, I<br />
              Don't wanna say goodbye<br />
              <br />
              Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day

              <br />
              I knew you in another life<br />
              You had that same look in your eyes<br />
